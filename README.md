### Hi there! 😁

My name is Thiago Tassinari, I'm Brazilian. I am in the 9th period of the computer engineering course at Uniceuma University and I am currently doing my TCC. A few months ago I am very interested in developing my Front-End programming logic skills using VS-Code and I hope to become a master professionally in this language.

In my spare time I play basketball and watch NBA games, I watch Netflix, I like to read scientific magazines (Scientific American and Natural Geografic), and also, keeping my promise to read the Bible completely, I like to prepare family meals and go out to eat with friends.

Would you like to meet me?
